<p class="lead"> The Swiss Holiday Websites provide varied premium holidays in Switzeland. The Swiss Holiday Company are the premier tour operator in the UK that focus on Switzeland holidays.</p>

<p> They requested us to redesign their websites (<a href="">swissholidayco.com</a>, <a href="http://www.swissskico.com/">swissskico.com</a>), and I was in charge of the new designs and front-end implementation.</p>
<img class="in c" src="proj/shc-web/old.png">
<p>My design strategy was to keep a minimalistic feel for the websites but use typography and color to achieve better texture.</p>

<p> The website is built on top of the new Trip Solutions CMS (eDitto) and I also worked closely with my colleague that integrated the markup to the CMS system.</p> 
<p><small>This project was completed while I was employed at <a href="http://www.tripsolutions.co.uk">Trip Solutions</a>.</small></p>
