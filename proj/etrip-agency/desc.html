<p class="lead"> Etrip Agency is a web-based booking management software for smaller travel agencies and independent travel agents. The software integrates with the Trip Solutions flight booking API and some of their partner tour operator's APIs. </p>

<p>My role in the project was to design and implement a new, user-friendly UI that was also usable on mobile devices. Because the software is rather complex, I had to design a system of consistent but flexible modules and clearly separate the navigation from actions. </p>
<p> I did a lot of work on optimizing user paths and trying to mimize user error. As a result, the UI is almost universaly acclaimed by our clients as being simple, understandable and effective. </p>
