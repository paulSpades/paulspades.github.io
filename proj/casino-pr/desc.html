<p class="lead"> These are a few of the casino promotion landing pages and banners that I've designed while working at path Pathwwway.</p>
<img class="fw" src="proj/casino-pr/fw1.jpg">
<p>The promotions were implemented and included inside the bingo and casino websites as static html, and each banner(featured at the top of the design) reworked in a few layouts and sizes for placement on the websites ( and affiliate) and newsletters/notifications.</p>
<p> Previously to joining the UX Team, I worked as a Senior Front-end Engineer at Pathwway on the same project. My switch to UX came because of a request from our Project Manager.</p>
<p>The gallery bellow shows a few of the intermediate(not final) designs. Everything else is, sadly, under strict NDA.</p>

<p><small>This project was completed at <a href="http://http://www.pathwwway.com/">Pathwwway</a>.</small></p>
