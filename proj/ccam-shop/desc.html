<p> I designed the branding, installed and tweaked the Wordpress instalation and modified the theme to better represent the brand. The UI is simplified and straight-forward for a streamlined shopping experience. And mobile-friendly, of course.</p>

<p>The single challege I came up against was theme hooks, as the concept didn't really exist 3-4 years ago when I've first learned to develop for Wordpress. But that was easily remedied in a few days, and I quickly managed to get up to speed on the latest best practices.</p>
