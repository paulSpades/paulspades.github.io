<p class="lead"> Trip Solutions is a travel software developer based in the UK and Romania. This is where's I've had the pleasure to work and sharpen my skills for about 5 years.</p>

<p>I worked with Trip solutions for 5 years as a designer and front-end developer. I've designed and developed everything from travel agency websites to custom icons, complex booking UIs to flight tickets and Trip Solution's own brand and websites. </p>
<p> I've also designed the previous iteration of this website, but the design language we were growing into warranted a fresh new look for our own online presence.</p> 
<img class="fw" src="proj/ts-web/ev.jpg">
<p>The website is mostly static on the back-end and it features a light, mobile-first front-end with striking colour but less distraction. Keeping with the mobile-first philosopy is also the full-screen navigation menu that preserves its simple mobile layout, even on desktop resolutions.</p>
