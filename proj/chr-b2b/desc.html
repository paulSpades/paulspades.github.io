<p class="lead"> Christian Tour is one of the main tour operators in Romania. They aproached us with building a new B2B app for their brand new Moldavia branch.</p>
<p>We knew we didn't want to base it on CHR's existing B2B web app, since it was showing its age and it needed to be updated or redone.</p>
<img class="fw" src="proj/chr-b2b/1.jpg">
<p>Our solution was to present a whole new UI based on their newly refresed identity and take advantage of new technology. This also enabled us to quickly turn over a version for their main, aging B2B app.</p>

<p>I developed the new design and UI, and implemented the front-end markup (AngularJS templates) and CSS. The UI is based on Angular UI and Bootstrap.</p>
