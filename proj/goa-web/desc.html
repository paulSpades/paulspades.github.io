<p class="lead"> I was tasked with creating a new, modern design for Goaway & Czeck-It-Out's website that was to be responsive and take advange of the new web technologies. </p>

<p>I started by refreshing the brand image and implementing a clean grid-like structure aided by bold typography and broken up by a wave-like graphic to add some graphical movement. </p>

<p>Sadly, the project didn't move forward past the mockup stage for various business reasons, although it received very good feedback.</p>
