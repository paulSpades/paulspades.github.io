<p class="lead"> This is a small part of the work that I did for the Tangiers Casino as a UX Designer.</p>
<img class="fw" src="proj/tng-refresh/fw1.jpg">
<p> Previously to joining the UX Team, I worked as a Senior Front-end Engineer at Pathwway on the same project. My switch to UX came because of a request from our Project Manager. The table above reflects the roles I've filled and technologies used.</p>
<p> Tangiers is only one of the online casinos from the project's continuous development, which were about two dozen at that time. The gallery bellow shows a few unimplemented re-designed features for Tangiers Casino. Everything else is, sadly, under strict NDA.</p>
