<p> Candycam shop is a fun web shop that ships cameras and photography accesories around the world.</p>
<p>The website uses Wordpress with the WooCommerce plugin and a modified version of the Storefront theme.</p>
<p> I designed the branding, installed and tweaked the Wordpress instalation and modified the theme to better represent the brand. The UI is simplified and straight-forward for a streamlined shopping experience. </p> 
<p>The single challege I came up against was theme hooks, as the concept didn't really exist 3-4 years ago when I've first learned to develop for Wordpress. But that was easily remedied in a few days, and I quickly managed to get up to speed on the latest best practices.</p>
